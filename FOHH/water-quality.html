            <p class='para-main text-white'>
              The southernmost part of Holmes Harbor was closed in mid-March by
              Island County Department of Health (ICDH) following a Washington
              State Department of Health (WSDOH) pollution study of the shellfish
              growing area.</br></br>
              Water samples from 17 discharge points collected on four seperate
              occassions exceeded fecal coliform standards, four of them consistently
              high. Two of the four are located at Freeland Park; the other two were
              found on Nichols Brothers Boat Builders (NBBBI) beach.</br>
              Both locations had readings of 2400 fc/100ml on November 3 and
              October 18, 2005. Permissible levels are less than 100fc/100ml.
              An earlier study* (May 2004), performed for Island County Public Works
              by Herrera Environmental Consultants, identified raised levels of
              pollution at the southern end of Holmes Harbor and requested that
              the County Commissioners apply for a grant to determine the source.
              The Commissioners assigned the Planning Department to address pollution
              levels on a county-wide basis, thus effectively postponing a timely
              follow-up for both locations at Holmes Harbor.</br></br>
              Now, with state action, these areas will remain unclassified and
              off-limits until the effects of past and present pollution sources have
              been assessed and remedied.  Meanwhile, both commercial and recreational
              harvesting of shellfish is prohibited from south of Ships Haven Drive
              on the west side of Holmes Harbor and across to Twin Oaks Lane because
              of its possible effect on human health. The shoreline from the closed
              boundary line north to just past the Holmes Harbor Golf Course, however,
              will also continue to be an unclassified area. Crab harvesting is
              permitted throughout Holmes Harbor.</br></br>
