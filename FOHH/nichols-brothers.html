            Nichols Brothers Boat Building, Inc. (NBBBI) was established on the south shore of Holmes Harbor more than forty years ago to repair small boat engines and hulls. Over the years their skills and capabilities grew to match the size and complexity of their
            boats. By the summer of 2003 they had completed and launched the 360-foot, 3500-ton Empress of the North. By Spring 2004 they had built and launched the fast Navy X-Craft. And by the end of 2004 they were proposing a major three-stage facilities
            expansion that would permit construction of vessels as large as Washington State Ferries - up to 400 feet long and 5,000 tons in weight. In May 2006 they announced orders for two $14M catamaran ferries for the San Francisco Marine Transit
            Authority. The Holmes Harbor community is proud of their success but wonders about the unintended consequences of such growth.
