            FOHH is a volunteer-based non-profit organization. It was established in 2004 by community members living near the south end of Holmes Harbor in response to accelerating growth. Supporters now include many from South Whidbey and beyond.</br>
            </br>
            We are dedicated to the preservation of the Holmes Harbor natural environment, the quality of life on Whidbey Island, and continuing responsible growth in Island County

          <!-- The catalyst to become involved in protecting the harbor's
              ecosystem stemmed from a land use proposal that appeared to threaten
              the natural environment and the quality of life of Holmes Harbor.
              FOHH continues to participate, investigate, clarify, and respond to
              new and ongoing issues affecting Holmes Harbor.

            <p class='para-main text-white'>
              Like the Holmes Harbor ecosystem and the surrounding community,
              Friends of Holmes Harbor (FOHH) is dynamic and evolving. The harbor's
              water quality has suffered over the past decades due to the ongoing
              pressures presented by the surrounding community development.</br>
              </br>
              In the effort to understand the delicate balance of an aquatic ecosystem,
              as a community organization, FOHH strives to examine and explain the
              issues facing the harbor, as well as the natural workings of the harbor.
              Hopefully, FOHH can lend a hand to a better understanding.

          <h1 id='issue-h1' style='text-align: center; font-size: 26px;'>Regarding new NBBB permit application!</h1>
          <p class='para-main text-white'>In a new permit application package, NBBB requests permission to expand their production area, increase their work week to 24/7, and extend work hours from 7pm to 10pm so they can continue with noise-producing manufacturing activities.</br>
            </br>
            Nichols also wants variances for exceeding Island County's height restriction for portable manufacturing buildings ("Big Tops"), and they appear to offer questionable abatement solutions.</br>
            </br>
            Most imporant, their permit package seems to be missing information about a future alternate launch system designed to support their production facility! (NBBB) withdrew their Master Permit Application when they last attempted expansion in 2004, which
            also required an EIS. Their withdrawal thus reset the whole permitting process.</br>
